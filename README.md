# Kicstarter Challenge Final Submission
## Overview of the project
**The purpose of the project was to learn excel, some basic statistics and key functions within excel to help a Crowdfunding Exercise**
The background for the project was to help Louise help launch a crowdfunding exercise by analysing data from past crowdfinding campaigns.Through the analysis we learned to create pivot tables and graphs which are one of the most widely used tools in any organisation.
